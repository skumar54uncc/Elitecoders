## Introduction

Orthopedic surgery practices in New York face significant challenges with claim denials, many of which stem from documentation errors. Understanding these common pitfalls is the first step toward reducing denials and improving revenue capture.

## 1. Incomplete Procedure Documentation

One of the most common errors is incomplete documentation of surgical procedures. Surgeons often focus on the technical aspects of the surgery but miss critical details that coders need to assign the correct CPT codes.

**Common issues include:**

- Missing details about the approach (open, arthroscopic, percutaneous)
- Unclear description of the extent of the procedure
- Lack of documentation for multiple procedures performed in the same session
- Missing information about hardware used (implants, screws, plates)

## 2. Modifier Misuse and Missing Modifiers

Modifiers are critical for accurate billing, especially in orthopedic surgery where multiple procedures are often performed. Common mistakes include:

- **Missing Modifier 51:** When multiple procedures are performed, Modifier 51 must be applied to the secondary procedures
- **Incorrect Modifier 59:** Used incorrectly when Modifier 51 should be used, or not used when procedures are truly distinct
- **Missing Modifier 22:** When a procedure requires significantly more work than usual, this modifier should be documented and used
- **Incorrect Laterality:** Missing RT/LT modifiers for bilateral procedures

## 3. Insufficient Medical Necessity Documentation

Payers require clear documentation of medical necessity for procedures. Many denials occur because:

- Pre-operative notes don't clearly establish why the procedure is necessary
- Conservative treatment attempts aren't documented
- Patient symptoms and functional limitations aren't clearly described
- Diagnostic test results that support the procedure aren't referenced

## Best Practices to Avoid Denials

1. **Use Templates:** Develop procedure-specific templates that prompt for all required documentation elements
2. **Regular Audits:** Conduct periodic chart reviews to identify patterns in documentation gaps
3. **Provider Education:** Regular training sessions on documentation requirements specific to orthopedic surgery
4. **Pre-Operative Checklists:** Ensure all necessary documentation is completed before procedures
5. **Work with Coders:** Establish communication channels between surgeons and coders to clarify documentation needs

## Conclusion

Reducing denials in orthopedic surgery requires attention to documentation detail. By addressing these common errors and implementing best practices, practices can significantly improve their first-pass payment rates and reduce administrative burden.
